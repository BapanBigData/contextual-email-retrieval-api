    "##### **Evaluations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conciseness & Structure** – The summaries are generally concise and maintain a readable structure, which aligns well with the goal of brevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Coverage of Main Points** – While some key ideas are captured, a few summaries miss critical context or actions, affecting the overall completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accuracy** – There is room to improve factual accuracy, particularly in correctly identifying entities and their roles within the communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Performance** – Initial attempts with models like facebook/bart-large-cnn yielded suboptimal results. Exploring alternatives such as t5-base, flan-t5-xl, or google/pegasus-xsum may enhance summary precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overall Assessment** – A solid start with potential. With refined model selection and slight manual calibration, the summaries can become more accurate, informative, and aligned with the original message intent."

    "#### **Response Generation Task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Evaluations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Contextual Relevance:** The responses generated by the LLM are contextually appropriate and align well with the user queries, thanks to the use of a faiss_index to retrieve relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Coherence:** The responses are generally coherent, maintaining logical flow and clarity when answering queries based on the provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relevance to Emails:** Key elements from emails—such as subject lines, people involved, and actions required—are accurately reflected in the generated responses, demonstrating high relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semantic Accuracy:** The LLM captures important semantic cues, ensuring the tone and content are consistent with the nature of the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Limitations:** The sophistication of responses is currently limited, likely due to the relatively small size of the underlying knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Final Thoughts and Future Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalability:** To enhance performance, the system can be extended using a NoSQL vector store and GPU-backed infrastructure for faster and larger-scale embedding and response generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Improvement:** Incorporating more powerful LLMs and embedding models will improve response richness, coherence, and contextual depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Production Readiness:** With improvements, this setup can evolve into a production-grade response generation system. A local API has already been implemented as a proof of concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generalizability:** The architecture can be adapted to support various business communication workflows through API-based deployment."
